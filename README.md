# CustomEnchantments-Learning
My attempt at creating custom enchantments, I am using this project to learn about more advanced custom enchantments!

The enchantments that currently work:

    Vacuum - Apply to pickaxe, sucks items into player inventory
    Smelt - Smelts blocks upon breaking, works with fortune!
    Dash - Applies to a sword, when right clicking you dash forwards
    Cockatrice - When right clicing spawns a chicken that hunts mobs and explodes when close to them!

The enchantments that are being worked on :

    Gambler - When mining has a chance at giving far greater rewards, risk of getting worse rewards
