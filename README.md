# CustomEnchantments-Learning
My attempt at creating custom enchantments, I am using this project to learn about more advanced custom enchantments!
Most enchantments can only currently be applied using the /enchant name command. name's below, e.g. /enchant dash

The enchantments that currently work:

    Vacuum - Apply to pickaxe, sucks items into player inventory
    Smelt - Smelts blocks upon breaking, works with fortune!
    Dash - Applies to a sword, when right clicking you dash forwards
    Cockatrice - When right clicing spawns a chicken that hunts mobs and explodes when close to them!

The enchantments that are being worked on :

    Gambler - When mining has a chance at giving far greater rewards, risk of getting worse rewards

Improvements being worked on:
    
    A way to apply enchants naturally in-game, killing mobs/enchantment GUI.
    Config support to enable/disable certain enchants.
    Config support to change the odds of effects occuring, e.g. Gambler
    Balancing and testing in a standard survival world.
