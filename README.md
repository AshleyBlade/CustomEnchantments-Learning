# CustomEnchantments-Learning
My attempt at creating custom enchantments, I am using this project to learn about more advanced custom enchantments!
Most enchantments can be applied using the /enchant or the /enchants command. 

Commands:
    
    /enchants - Opens the Enchantment GUI.
    /enchant - Applies an enchant to the item in the player's hand.

The enchantments that currently work:

    Vacuum - Apply to pickaxe, sucks items into player inventory.
    Smelt - Smelts blocks upon breaking, works with fortune!
    Dash - Applies to a sword, when right clicking you dash forwards.
    Cockatrice - When right clicing spawns a chicken that hunts mobs and explodes when close to them!
    Gambler - When mining multiplies the drops by a random double between 0.5 and 1.75.

The enchantments that are being worked on :

    Gambler - balancing.

Improvements being worked on:
    
    Enchantment GUI design.
    Config support to enable/disable certain enchants.
    Config support to change the odds of effects occuring, e.g. Gambler
    Balancing and testing in a standard survival world.
    Gambler riskiness.
    Random enchantment functionality within GUI. Like a crate but has a cost in the menu and rolls similarly to a loot box.
    Vault implementation to allow a cost for enchantments
